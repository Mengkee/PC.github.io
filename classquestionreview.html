      <h2>Question 1</h2>
      A woman was suggested that, if the interest rate was at 4.86% per annum and she continued to pay $2,500 per month into her fund, than her fund would be worth 1 million at the end of 20 years.
      <br>
      However, her fund fell short of 1 million with the average return calculated as 5.08%.
      <br>
      Why?
      <h2>Answer 1</h2>
      A good place to start is to check that investing $2,500 per month at 4.86% per annum does produce a fund of $1 million after 20 years. You could then tell the woman that you have verified that the projection is correct.
      <br>
      It should be explained to the woman that the projected fund of $1 million assumed a constant return of 4.86% per annum over the 20-year period. If investment returns vary over time, the projected fund will be different from $1 million, even if the 20-year average return is 4.86%.
      <br>
      The reason for this was covered in the Week 1 lecture slides. In making regular investments over a fixed period, returns in the later years have a greater impact because they are earned on a larger fund. Hence we can deduce that the woman’s final fund fell short of $1 million because the unit price grew more quickly in the earlier years and less quickly in the later years.
      <br>
      Another way of explaining this is to note that the 20-year return of 5.08% per annum was only achieved on the first $2,500 invested. All the other sums were invested later and achieved a return that depended on the unit price at the time of purchase. If the unit price increased more quickly in the early years, future sums were invested at higher prices than expected, hence the return on those sums was lower than 5.08% per annum.
     <br>
      Some common errors are discussed below.
      <br>
      Woman’s calculation of 5.08% per annum assumed a lump sum investment over 20 years
       <br>
      Many students thought that because the woman had calculated a 20-year return of 5.08% per annum, the projected fund of $1 million was based on an initial lump sum investment. This is obviously not true, as you should have checked for yourself. The likely explanation for this error is that the previous question covered in class used this idea. Re-using the answer to a previous question instead of thinking about the current question from first principles is a common type of mistake.
      <br>
      Expenses and charges
       <br>
      The questions stated that investment income in the mutual fund was re-invested net of charges and expenses. This means that expenses and charges were deducted from the investment income before it was re-invested. Students who gave expenses and charges as a reason either did not understand what ‘net of expenses and charges’ meant, or thought that because they were mentioned in the question they must be part of the answer.
       <br>
      Number of units purchased
     <br>
      A few students said that the fund was smaller than $1 million because the number of units purchase by each investment of $2,500 would have fallen over time as the unit price increased. This is true but not relevant. If the unit price had increased by 5.08% every year, the number of units purchased would have fallen by 5.08% every year, but the final fund would have been greater than $1 million.
       <br>
      Incorrect use of word “risky”
     <br>
      A few students used the word “risky” in describing the returns on the mutual fund. Returns that have occurred in the past are never “risky”, even if they have varied over time. Only uncertain future returns can be risky.

      <h2>Question 2</h2>
      A man with no dependent wants to withdraw money from his whole life policy.
      <br>
      Should he withdraw right now or wait until next year?
      <h2>Answer 2</h2>
      To answer this question you need to know:
      <br>
      (1)        that the surrender value is based on the actuarial reserve for the Whole Life policy.
      <br>
      (2)        how the actuarial reserve increases over time.

      <br>
      Although the actuarial reserve is normally calculated as a prospective reserve, the retrospective reserve is more useful for understanding how the reserve changes as the policyholder ages. These two reserves are equal if the same mortality and interest assumptions are used to calculate them.
     <br>
      The retrospective reserve is equal to {past premiums – expenses incurred – cost of life cover} accumulated with interest. The cost of life cover is equal to:
      <br>
      qx+t.(S - Rx+t+1)
      <br>
      Please study the Week 3 lecture slides and the reserve tables in Moodle to understand how the reserve changes over time.
      <br>
      As the cost of life cover is deducted from each year’s reserve, the man’s wealth would have grown at a faster rate if he had taken the surrender value 5 years’ ago and invested it the same assets held by the insurer (i.e. fixed interest bonds). He did not do this, but he should take the surrender value of £185,000 now to avoid paying for life cover that he does not need. This is the main point that needs to be made in the answer.
       <br>
      What about the man’s profit calculation over the past 5 years? This calculation is correct, but it does not prove that he earned a good return. The internal rate of return was actually less than 1% per annum, and this should have been explained to the man.
     <br>
      It is possible that the whole-life policy might have ‘rider’ benefits for critical illness cover or disability insurance. The man should be advised to check whether his policy has such benefits and be aware that he would lose them if he surrendered the policy. It was not necessary to raise this point to achieve a good mark, but one would expect an experienced actuary to have mentioned it.
      <br>
      Some of the errors made that lost marks are discussed below.
      <br>
      Premiums paid up to age 55
      <br>
      Some students thought it was relevant to calculate that the total premiums paid up to age 55 (£135,000), which were less than the surrender value offered at age 55. The fact that he made a loss over this period is irrelevant, because the policy provided life cover that he needed when his wife was alive. Furthermore, nothing that happened in the past has any relevance to the decision he has to make now, i.e. whether to take the surrender value of £185,000 or wait another 5 years.
      <br>
      Alternative investments to whole-life policy
      <br>
      Some students advised the man to invest the surrender value in specific investments or insurance policies, e.g. a life annuity. It would be unprofessional to provide such advice without full knowledge of the client’s financial position, objectives and attitude to risk.  It would also be illegal to provide such advice in the UK unless you were authorised to provide investment advice, which many actuaries are not.
      <br>
      Risk of dying over next 5 years
       <br>
      Some students thought that the man’s risk of dying over the next 5 years was relevant to the decision. This would only be true if he wanted to spend the surrender value before age 65. The question implies he wants to save for his retirement, so if he took the surrender value he would invest it until age 65. As he has no beneficiary to provide for on death, the size of the death benefit paid to his estate would not matter to him
      <h2>Question 3</h2>
      An investor is reviewing the investment performance of two fixed interest government bonds in his portfolio. He bought both these bonds three years ago. The current price of each bond is compared with its purchase price in the table below.
 <br>
      Name of bond | Redemption date | Current price  | Purchase price <br>
      8% Treasury 2023 | 31/12/2023 | £127.00 | £139.00 <br>
      4% Treasury 2060 | 31/12/2060 | £157.00 | £125.00 <br>
 <br>
      The investor observes that 4% Treasury 2060 has been a far superior investment to 8% Treasury 2023. As a result, he plans to sell his holdings in 8% Treasury 2023 and reinvest them in 4% Treasury 2060.
 <br>
      Explain to the investor why the performance of these bonds has differed over the past three years, and advise him on the consequences of his planned transactions.

      <h2>Answer 3</h2>
      The investor believes that 4% Treasury 2060 has been a far superior investment to 8% Treasury 2023 over the past 3 years. It is easy to verify that this is correct. The total cash return earned on each bond since he bought them were:
 <br>
      8% Treasury 2023: 3x£8 + (£127 – £139) = £12
 <br>
      4% Treasury 2060: 3x£4 + (£157 - £125) = £44
 <br>
      The cash returns calculated above include both interest and the capital gain/loss because this is what the investor cares about. Comparing investment performance means comparing total returns. It would be more correct to compare the IRR on each bond over the past 3 years, but this would be a less easy calculation. Comparing total cash returns makes it obvious that the second bond has provided a superior return.
 <br>
      There is no need to put these calculations in your answer. A good initial statement would be: “You are correct that 4% Treasury 2060 has provided a superior return over the past 3 years than 8% Treasury 2023”.

 <br>
      ##Explaining the difference in performance
 <br>
      The price of 4% Treasury 2060 has increased, but the price of 8% Treasury 2023 has fallen. This has happened because the bonds have different features that make them behave differently.
 <br>
      8% Treasury 2023 is a high coupon bond with a short term to redemption. Hence, its premium to par is falling quickly and will tend to zero as the bond nears redemption. (You should verify this by deriving a simple formula for the premium to par).
 <br>
      4% Treasury 2060 is a medium coupon bond with a long term to redemption. Its premium to par is falling at a much slower rate. Its long duration makes its price very volatile, i.e. sensitive to changes in maturity yield.
 <br>
      Over the past 3 years, the maturity yield on 8% Treasury 2023 has fallen from about 2% to 1%. This fall in yield makes its price higher than it otherwise would have been. But its price has still fallen over the past 3 years, because the reduction in premium to par on nearing maturity had a much bigger effect.
 <br>
      Over the past 3 years, the maturity yield on 4% Treasury 2060 has fallen from about 3% to 2%. This reduction in yield had a much bigger impact on its price because of the bond’s long duration and high volatility.
 <br>
      The reduction in maturity yields on both bonds indicates that interest rates have fallen over the past 3 years. Hence, the superior performance on 4% Treasury 2060 is explained by greater impact of falling interest rates on the price of this bond.
 <br>
      ##Should the investor re-invest in 4% Treasury 2060?
 <br>
      The investor is considering whether to sell 8% Treasury 2023 and re-invest in 4% Treasury 2060 because the second bond has provided a superior return over the past 3 years. Will this continue in future?
 <br>
      Although 4% Treasury 2060 currently has a higher maturity yield than 8% Treasury 2023, its term to redemption is so much greater that comparing maturity yields is not helpful. In any case, it is very unlikely that the investor would hold 4% Treasury 2060 until maturity, even if he were still alive in 2060.
 <br>
      It is more useful to compare returns over the next 4 years until 8% Treasury 2023 matures. The return on 8% Treasury 2023 over the next 4 years will be definitely be close to its maturity yield of 1% per annum. Re-investment risk is small over such a short period.
 <br>
      However, the return on 4% Treasury 2060 is very uncertain over the next 4 years because the price of the bond is volatile. If its maturity yield falls or stays the same, it will continue to outperform the first bond. But if its maturity yield rises, its price will fall and its return might be negative.
 <br>
      It follows that selling 8% Treasury 2023 and re-investing in 4% Treasury 2060 is a risky strategy.  The return on the second bond could be much higher or much lower than 1% per annum.

      <h2>Question 4</h2>
      A life assurance company introduces a new option for its non-profit endowment assurance policies. Policyholders will be allowed to extend the term of their policies for ten years without paying further premiums. The sum paid on death will not change, but the maturity value will increase by a percentage that depends on the age of the policyholder. The table below shows the percentage increase in maturity value for policyholders at different ages.
 <br>
      Age at start of policy extension | Increase in maturity value <br>
      50 | 37% <br>

      60 | 42% <br>

      70 | 58% <br>

      A financial journalist asks why older policyholders are offered a larger increase in their maturity value. Explain to the journalist why this is so.
 <br>
      <h2>Answer 4</h2>
      The maturity value offered on the extended policy must be derived from an actuarial calculation.
 <br>
      To see what this calculation is, we note that the insurer is (in effect) offering a new single premium policy, where the single premium is equal to the sum assured of the old policy. This single premium must be approximately equal to the expected present value of the benefits provided, which are:
 <br>
      (a) a return of the single premium on death within 10 years;
 <br>
      (b) the single premium plus a guaranteed percentage increase on maturity.
 <br>
      The increase in the maturity value is greater for older policyholders. Most students realised this must be because mortality increases with age, but this is not an adequate explanation. If the same benefit were provided on death and maturity (as in a conventional endowment assurance policy), older policyholders would receive a lower benefit.
 <br>
      Hence, the key to this question is understanding and explaining how mortality effects the pricing of an assurance contract. This was covered in Week 3 of Term 1. If we have a policy where the cost of life cover is a negative item deducted from the actuarial reserve, higher mortality increases the cost of the policy. But if a positive mortality income is added to reserve, as in a life annuity contract, higher mortality reduces the cost of the policy.
 <br>
      The formula for the mortality gain/(loss) is:
 <br>
      qx(Reserve at death − Death benefit)
 <br>
      For the 10-year policy extension, the initial reserve is the single premium. This increases over time to become the maturity value after 10 years. Hence the reserve at death is always greater than death benefit (which is equal to the initial reserve). It follows that mortality income is earned during the policy extension, so higher mortality results in a higher maturity value.
 <br>
      An easy way of explaining this is to say that all the interest earned on the reserves of policyholders who die within 10 years is added to the maturity values of the survivors. Hence, if more policyholders die within 10 years, more interest is added to the maturity values.
 <br>
      Some common errors are discussed below:
 <br>
      Maturity value must be greater because it is less likely to be paid
 <br>
      Some students said the maturity value must be greater simply because it is less likely to be paid. As explained above, this is not a correct explanation. A greater maturity value can only be provided because surplus funds are generated when deaths occur.
 <br>
      Older policyholders paid higher premiums before the policy extension
 <br>
      Some students thought that paying higher premiums before the policy extension would result in a higher maturity value after the policy extension. This is not so, because the new maturity value is equal to the old maturity value plus a fixed percentage increase. The premiums paid before the policy extension are irrelevant.
 <br>
      Incentives, rewards and marketing
 <br>
      Some students discussed the need to provide ‘incentives’ for older policyholders to extend their policy or ‘reward’ policyholders who were less likely to survive to maturity. This is not a valid explanation because policy terms must always be based on correct actuarial pricing. There is no point writing more business at a loss.
 <br>
      Option on original policy?
 <br>
      Some students thought that the policy extension must have been an option on the original policy. The question does not say this, but it would not explain why older policyholders were offered the extension on more favourable terms. Always answer the question before you from first principles instead of trying to use the answer to some other question you have seen.

      <h2>Question 5</h2>
      <h2>Answer 5</h2>

      For the VC fund the loan is an asset, similar to a 10-year fixed interest bond with a maturity yield of 10% per annum. A high maturity yield of 10% was required to compensate for the risk of the restaurant failing and defaulting on its debt. As the restaurant is now successful, the default risk is lower. Consequently, the VC fund uses a discount rate lower than 10% to value the future cash flows of the loan. This increases the value of the loan to above par value, and the VC fund will not settle the loan for less than its current value. The proposed settlement value of £1.22m implies a discount rate of 5% per annum.
 <br>
      This can be explained to the chef by pointing out that the VC fund only provided this risky loan because of the possibility of achieving a high return over 10 years. Now that the restaurant is successful, the loan is worth more to the VC fund than the amount originally advanced. If it were to accept a settlement of £1m, it would be sacrificing part of the reward for making a risky investment.
 <br>
      The settlement value of £1.22m implies that the VC fund would now lend to the restaurant at 5% per annum. The chef can judge whether this is reasonable by comparing it to the interest rate the bank is charging for refinancing the debt. If the bank is charging a lower interest rate, settling the loan for £1.22m would be to his advantage.
 <br>
      I will now discuss some common errors.
 <br>
      Compensation for lost interest payments
 <br>
      Many students said that VC fund required the extra £220,000 as compensation for lost interest payments. This is not a correct explanation. The value of the lost interest payments must be added to the value of the principal repayment due in 5 years to get the full value of the loan. This full value is only higher than £1million because the restaurant in now successful, so the discount rate is lower. If the restaurant had been struggling to make a profit, the VC fund might have accepted less than £1 million to settle the loan.
 <br>
      The relevance of the 4% mortgage rate
 <br>
      The TV chef mentioned his mortgage rate was 4% per annum 5 years ago. This was his way of explaining why he thought 10% per annum was a high interest rate to be paying. The figure has no relevance to the current discount rate for the loan, and should not have been used in your answer to the chef.
