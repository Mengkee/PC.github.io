      <h2>Some notes in answering all the questions: (To avoid being called "having mental block", you need to)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I must address this person directly and I must not include actuarial calculations of any kind in the answer sheet.
      </li>
      <li> However, you need to perform calculations where necessary. You can only write down the <span class="highlight">results of your calculation, but not the process.</span>
      </li>
      <li>I must address this person directly.
      </li>
      <li> Only write down precise points. Avoid using ambiguous statements.
      </li>
      <li> You need to remind your client if they make unreasonable assumptions.
      </li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Mortgage question</h2>
     <p>For the interest-only mortagage, each payment repays all the interest accumulated, and the capital is paid out at the end of the term.</p>
     <p>For others, each	mortgage	payment	is	a	combination	of	interest	and	debt repayment,	calculated	so	that the mortgage will	be	fully	repaid	at	the	end	of	the	term.	</p>
     <p>The common mistake is assuming entire	mortgage payment	consists	of	interest.</p>
     <p>To illustrate your point, you need to calculate the exact composition of the interest and the mortgage repayment in the each monthly payment. </p>
     <p>	As	the outstanding	debt	reduces,	the	interest	component	falls	and	the	debt repayment	increases	by	the	same	amount.</p>
     <p>Higher the interest, lower the initial debt repayment.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col">
     <h2>Pension question</h2>
     <p>The purpose of pension is to provide secure income to the investors when they retire.</p>
     <p>More interest is earned when the pension pot is relatively large.</p>
     <p>Investment	returns	at	later	durations	will	have	a	bigger	impact	on	the	value	of	the	fund.	</p>
     <p>Do not give suggestions without the information on	the	current maturity	yield, your clients' risk appetite etc.	</p>
     <p></p>
     <p>When analysing the question, pay attention to your client's health status.</p>

   </div>
   <div class="col">
     <h2>Bond market question</h2>
     <p>Two factors affecting the price of the government bond.</p>
     <p>The price of the bond varies on daily basis, corresponding to the changes in the interest rate.</p>
     <p>Higher the term to maturity, higher volatility inherent in the bond price.</p>
     <p>The bond price converges to its par value, as the term to maturity decreases to zero.</p>
     <p>Instead of yield (IRR), you should try to form your answer in terms of <span class="highlight">cash return</span>. The cash returns include
       both interest and the capital gain/loss because this is what the investor cares about</p>
       <p>The fears for uncertain inflation can also influence the price of bond, but it is a less significant factor.</p>
       <p>For the corporate bond, the risk of default comes into play.</p>

<h2>Life insurance question</h2>
<p>For	both	the	whole-life	and	endowment	policies,	the	premiums	build	up	a	reserve	which
grows	over	the	life	of	the	policy. 	This	reserve	includes	interest	earned	on	the	premiums,	but
also	has	various	charges	and	expenses	deducted	from	it.		</p>
<p>Surrender	values	and	paid-up	policy	values	are	based	on	the	policy	reserve
at	the	time	of	surrender	or	lapse.</p>
<p>The	net	premium	reserve	is	the	accumulated	net	premiums
less	the	accumulated	cost	of	life	cover.	</p>
<p>	A	surrender	value	is	a	discretionary	payment	that
the	insurer	will	certainly	reduce	if	the	reserve	is	lower	than	anticipated.	A	maturity	value,	by
contrast,	must	always	be	paid	in	full,	even	if	the	insurer	has	to	take	a	loss.</p>
<p>The surrender value for the endowmment policy / whole life policy will increase over time.</p>
<p>Surrender	values	are	not	normally	paid	on	term	life	or	life	annuity	policies.	The reserve for the term policy will increase until reaching a peak, and decrease.</p>
<p>Cost of life cover: charges	were	deducted	from	the	whole-life	reserve	to	cover	the	cost	of	providing	life	insurance</p>
<p>Moratality income for annuities: qx+t.Rx+t+1	is	the	mortality	income	between	t	and	t+1,	which	enables
annuities	to	pay	a	higher	income	than	the	investment	return	on	the
assets	in	the	annuity	fund	(mainly	bonds). The	mortality	income	arises	because	the	reserves	held	for	annuitants
who	die	are	retained	by	the	insurance	company.	</p>
<p>Mortality drag: An	individual	may	prefer	to	draw	income	from	a	pension	pot	rather	than
buy	a	life	annuity.	Can	the	individual	draw	the	same	income	that	a	life	annuity	would	have
provided	without	later	being	worse	off?	Only	if	the	investment	return	on	the	pension	pot	is	greater	than	the
investment	return	on	the	life	annuity	reserves.	The	extra	investment	return	required	on	the	pension	pot	is	called
mortality	drag.

  <h2>Sensitivity to assumptions</h2>
  <p>Actuaries	should	be	able	to	explain	the	sensitivity	of	their	calculations
to	changes	in	different	assumptions.</p>
  <p>Sensitivity to interest rate</p>
  <p>The	sensitivity	of	the	price	(P)	of	an	asset	to	a	change	in	the	force	of
interest	(δ)	is	measured	by	its	volatility.	Volatility	≈	percentage	increase	in	asset	price	caused	by	reducing
discount	rate	by	one	percentage	point. Volatility = Discounted Mean Term	</p>
<p>DMT	increases	with	N	and	falls	with	δ.</p>
<p>Sensitivity to mortality.</p>
<p>The	effect	of	lighter	mortality	on	pricing	life	assurance	contracts
depends	on	factors	such	as: <ul>
  <li>the	type	of	policy
  </li>
  <li>	the	initial	age	of	the	policyholder
  </li>
  <li>	the	term	of	the	policy
  </li>
</ul></p>
<p>Sensitivity to expenses.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providers	of	financial	products	incur	expenses	which	are	recouped
from	the	customer	in	one	way	or	another
  </li>
  <li>Initial	expenses	arise	from	activities	such	as	administration,
underwriting	and	the	payment	of	fees/commission	to	advisers/
agents.	For	most	contracts,	they	are	the	bulk	of	the	expenses.
  </li>
  <li>Expenses	can	be	recouped	through	transparent	charges,	loadings	to
premiums	or	reductions	in	benefits.
  </li>
  <li>Consumer loans </li>
  <li>The	interest	rate	charged	in	consumer	loans	would	normally	be	set	at
a	level	to	cover	expenses.

  </li>
  <li>However,	there	may	also	be	transparent	fees,	such	as:<br>
-	an	initial	arrangement	fee	for	a	mortgage,	which	may	be	added
to	the	customer’s	debt;<br>
-	an	annual	credit	card	fee,	possibly	offset	by	an	annual	cashback
payment	on	transactions.
  </li>

  <li>Savings products
  </li>
  <li>The	interest	rate	paid	on	cash	accounts	is	normally	net	of	expenses.
  </li>
  <li>Some	managed	funds	sell	units	at	a	higher	price	than	they	redeem
them	(the	“bid/offer	spread”)	to	cover	initial	expenses.
  </li>
  <li>In	addition,	the	fund	manager	takes	an	annual	charge	equal	to	a	fixed
percentage	of	the	assets	in	the	fund.
  </li>
  <li>
    The	bid	price	at	which	units	are	redeemed	is	net	of	all	charges.
  </li>
  <li>Life assurance policies</li>
  <li>
    Premiums	for	life	assurance	policies	have	loadings	to	cover	initial	and
renewal	expenses.
  </li>
  <li>Initial	expenses	include	underwriting	and	administration	costs.

  </li>
  <li>In	the	UK,	commission	is	only	paid	on	non-profits	policies.	Both	initial
and	renewal	commissions	are	paid.
  </li>
  <li>
    No	commissions	are	paid	on	with-profits	and	unit-linked	policies,	but
the	customer’s	financial	adviser	may	charge	a	transparent	fee.
  </li>
  <li>
    Underwriting	costs	depend	on	the	age	of	applicant,	size	of	policy	and
information	given	in	the	application	form.
  </li>
  <li>
    The	lowest	underwriting	costs	occur	when	the	insurer	believes	that
the	information	in	the	application	form	is	sufficient.
  </li>
  <li>
    The	highest	underwriting	costs	occur	when	the	insurer	requires	the
applicant	to	have	a	medical	examination.
  </li>
  <li>Life annuities
  </li>
  <li>
    There	are	no	underwriting	costs	for	standard	annuities	sold	to	lives	in
good	health.
  </li>
  <li>
    Underwriting	is	only	required	for	enhanced	annuities	sold	to	impaired
lives	subject	to	higher	mortality.

  </li>
  <li>
    Underwriting	costs,	administration	costs	and	commission	are
deducted	from	the	sum	invested.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hence	the	income	paid	to	the	policyholder	is	net	of	all	expenses.	
  </li>
